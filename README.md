# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects I've worked on independently, showcasing my skills in deep learning, computer vision, and more.

## 1. Deep Fake Detector

This project allows you to upload an image of a face, and it will return a confidence percentage indicating whether the face is a deep fake or not. The model is built using TensorFlow.

### How to Run:

1. Download and run the Jupyter notebook **Fake_Face_Detection.ipynb** to train the model.
2. Ensure that the trained model is saved in the same directory as the application.
3. The application will use this model to classify the uploaded images.

It is recommended to run this project on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## 2. Image Colorization

This project takes black-and-white images and colorizes them using deep learning techniques. The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and includes methods like learning rate optimization to improve performance.

### How to Run:

1. Follow the instructions in the notebook on Kaggle to train and use the colorization model.
2. Upload black-and-white images to the application for colorization.
